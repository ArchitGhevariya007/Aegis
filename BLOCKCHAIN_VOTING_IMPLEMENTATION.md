# Blockchain Voting System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Aegis voting system now stores all votes on the blockchain for immutability, transparency, and verifiability. Votes are stored in both MongoDB (for fast access) and on the Ethereum blockchain (for permanent verification).

### What Gets Stored on Blockchain

**Anonymized Vote Record:**
- Vote Hash (SHA-256)
- Session ID
- Timestamp
- Face Verification Status
- **NOT stored:** User identity, Party selection (maintains anonymity)

**Blockchain Details:**
- Network: Polygon Amoy Testnet (configurable)
- Transaction Type: Data transaction
- Gas Limit: 25,000
- Gas Price: 30 Gwei

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Backend

1. **`server/services/blockchainService.js`**
   - Added `storeVote()` method - Stores vote hash on blockchain
   - Added `verifyVote()` method - Verifies vote from transaction hash
   - Creates immutable transaction record on Ethereum network

2. **`server/models/Voting.js`**
   - Added `blockchainData` field to voter schema:
     ```javascript
     blockchainData: {
       transactionHash: String,
       blockNumber: String,
       voteHash: String,
       verified: Boolean,
       timestamp: String
     }
     ```
   - Updated `castVote()` method to call blockchain service
   - Handles blockchain failures gracefully (continues with vote)

3. **`server/routes/votingRoutes.js`**
   - Updated `/cast-vote` endpoint to return blockchain data
   - Updated `/admin/results` endpoint to include:
     - `blockchainVerifiedCount` - Total blockchain-verified votes
     - `recentVotes` with blockchain verification status

### Frontend

1. **`client/src/Components/UserDashboard/VotingSystem.js`**
   - Shows blockchain verification status in success message
   - Displays transaction hash (truncated) after voting

2. **`client/src/Components/AdminDashboard/VotingPanel.js`**
   - Added "Blockchain Verified" statistics card
   - Shows blockchain verification count and percentage
   - Updated recent voters table with blockchain column
   - Transaction hash tooltip on hover

---

## üîê Security Features

### Vote Anonymization
- Only a hash of the vote is stored on blockchain
- Hash includes: `sessionId + partyId + timestamp + faceVerified`
- User identity (userId, email) NOT included in blockchain record
- Party selection encrypted in hash - cannot reverse-engineer

### Immutability
- Once stored on blockchain, votes cannot be altered
- Transaction hash provides permanent proof
- Block number ensures chronological ordering

### Verification
- Each vote gets a unique transaction hash
- Votes can be verified on blockchain explorer
- Hash proves vote integrity without revealing content

---

## üìä Admin Dashboard Features

### New Statistics
1. **Blockchain Verified Count**
   - Shows how many votes are blockchain-verified
   - Displays percentage of total votes
   - Amber-colored card with üîó icon

2. **Recent Voters Table**
   - Added "Blockchain" column
   - Shows "üîó Verified" or "Not Stored"
   - Hover over verified votes to see transaction hash

### Real-time Monitoring
- Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
- Live blockchain verification status
- Transaction hash tracking

---

## üó≥Ô∏è Voting Flow with Blockchain

### User Experience
1. User logs in and navigates to Voting
2. Clicks "Start Face Verification"
3. Camera modal opens, user captures face
4. AI verifies face against registered ID
5. User selects party
6. Clicks "Submit Vote"
7. **Backend Process:**
   - Validates user hasn't voted
   - Stores vote in MongoDB
   - **Creates blockchain transaction**
   - Waits for transaction confirmation
   - Returns success with transaction hash
8. User sees success message with blockchain verification ‚úÖ
9. Transaction hash displayed (e.g., "0x1234...abcd")

### Admin Experience
1. Admin starts voting session
2. Users cast votes (stored on blockchain)
3. Admin views real-time results
4. Dashboard shows:
   - Total votes
   - Blockchain verified count
   - Recent votes with blockchain status
   - Transaction hashes for verification

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Blockchain Configuration
BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology
BLOCKCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Optional: IPFS for document storage (already configured)
PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_key
PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret
```

### Network Options
- **Testnet (Current)**: Polygon Amoy
- **Mainnet**: Polygon, Ethereum, BSC
- **Private**: Local blockchain (Ganache, Hardhat)

---

## üí° Technical Details

### Vote Hash Generation
```javascript
voteHash = SHA256({
  sessionId: "voting_session_id",
  partyId: "selected_party",
  timestamp: "2025-10-23T...",
  faceVerified: true
})
```

### Blockchain Transaction
```javascript
{
  to: wallet_address,
  value: 0,
  data: "VOTE:{hash_first_32_chars}",
  gasLimit: 25000,
  gasPrice: 30 Gwei
}
```

### Data Storage
- **MongoDB**: Full vote record (userId, partyId, email, etc.)
- **Blockchain**: Anonymized hash + metadata
- **Dual Storage**: Fast queries + permanent verification

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Vote Not Blockchain Verified
- **Cause**: Blockchain service failure
- **Impact**: Vote still counted in MongoDB
- **Status**: Shows "Not Stored" in admin panel
- **Action**: Check blockchain connection, RPC URL, wallet balance

### Transaction Pending
- **Cause**: Network congestion
- **Impact**: Vote counted, waiting for blockchain confirmation
- **Action**: Wait for block confirmation (usually < 5 seconds)

### Low Wallet Balance
- **Cause**: Insufficient MATIC for gas fees
- **Action**: Add MATIC to wallet address
- **Faucet**: https://faucet.polygon.technology

---

## üìù Notes

- Votes are stored on blockchain AFTER database storage
- Blockchain failure doesn't prevent voting (graceful degradation)
- Each vote costs ~0.00075 MATIC (gas fees)
- Transaction hashes can be verified publicly
- User anonymity maintained through hashing

---

## üéâ Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ All votes stored on blockchain
- ‚úÖ Transaction hashes generated
- ‚úÖ Admin can view blockchain verification status
- ‚úÖ Users see blockchain confirmation
- ‚úÖ Vote integrity verifiable
- ‚úÖ Anonymous yet auditable
