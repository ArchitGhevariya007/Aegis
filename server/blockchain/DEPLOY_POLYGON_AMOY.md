## 💰 Gas Costs (Testnet - FREE)

Estimated gas for operations:

| Operation | Gas Cost | MATIC Cost |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deploy Contract | ~2,000,000 gas | ~0.05 MATIC |
| Start Voting | ~50,000 gas | ~0.0012 MATIC |

## 🔐 Security Notes

Your votes are now:
- ✅ **On real blockchain** (Polygon Amoy)
- ✅ **Publicly verifiable** (PolygonScan)
- ✅ **Immutable** (cannot be changed)
- ✅ **Transparent** (anyone can verify counts)
- ✅ **Decentralized** (no single point of control)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### MetaMask Not Connecting
- Make sure you're on Polygon Amoy network
- Refresh Remix page
- Disconnect and reconnect MetaMask

### Not Enough MATIC
- Visit another faucet (links in Step 3)
- Wait 24 hours and try original faucet again
- Each faucet gives you enough for ~100 transactions

### Transaction Failing
- Increase gas limit in MetaMask
- Make sure you have enough MATIC for gas
- Check if voting is already active/inactive

### Contract Not Showing in Remix
- Make sure contract deployed successfully
- Check PolygonScan for contract creation
- Look for contract under "Deployed Contracts" section

### Server Can't Connect to Contract
- Verify `VOTING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `.env`
- Make sure address starts with `0x`
- Restart server after adding address

## 🎯 What's Different from Remix VM?

| Feature | Remix VM | Polygon Amoy |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Cost | FREE | FREE (testnet) |
| Speed | Instant | 2-5 seconds |
| Persistence | Resets on close | Permanent |
| Verification | Local only | Public on explorer |
| Real Blockchain | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## 🚀 Ready for Production?

When ready to deploy to **Polygon Mainnet** (real money):

1. Get real MATIC (buy on exchange)
2. In MetaMask, add Polygon Mainnet:
   - RPC: `https://polygon-rpc.com`
   - Chain ID: `137`
3. Same deployment steps as above
4. **Costs real money** (~$0.10 per deployment)

---

## 📝 Save These Details

After deployment, save:
- ✅ Contract Address: `0x...`
- ✅ Deployment Transaction: `0x...`
- ✅ Block Explorer Link: `https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0x...`
- ✅ Deployer Address: Your wallet address
